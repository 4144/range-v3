range-v3
========

Experimental range library for C++11/14/17. This code will eventualy form the basis of a formal proposal to add range support to the C++ standard library.

**Dislaimer:** This code is undocumented, untested, contantly changing, and generally not fit for *any use whatsoever*.

To Do:
------

* Harmonize concepts with [N3351](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3351.pdf)
* Rip out algorithm piping.
* Survey the algorithms for return types.
* Migrate to EoP formulations of the algorithms.
